- Open a ms paint window or any program you can draw
- Set the paint window 700x630 width:700 height:630. If you want to change these setting you have to change top,left,right and buttom parameters in prediction.py
- Drag the window to top left corner of computer screen and drop it.
- Set the background color black and set the brush color white
- Open a cmd or terminal window and run prediction.py

```
